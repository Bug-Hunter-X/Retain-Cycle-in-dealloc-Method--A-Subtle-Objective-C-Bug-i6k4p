In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods (or their modern counterparts, `strong` and `weak` properties) within a custom `dealloc` method.  Specifically, if you accidentally retain an object within `dealloc`, you create a retain cycle that prevents proper deallocation.  This is subtle because the retain happens during the object's destruction process. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) OtherClass *otherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    //INCORRECT: Retaining 'otherObject' prevents deallocation
    [otherObject retain]; 
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

This incorrect `retain` creates a retain cycle if `otherObject` also holds a reference to `self`. Even though `dealloc` is called, the object won't be deallocated until the cycle is broken.

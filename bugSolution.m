The solution is simple: remove the incorrect `retain` call from within the `dealloc` method.  The object's reference should be released or its strong property set to nil *before* calling `[super dealloc]` (or allowing ARC to handle memory management).

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) OtherClass *otherObject; //Using ARC
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    //CORRECT: Release 'otherObject' properly
    self.otherObject = nil; // For ARC
    [super dealloc]; //Needed only if not using ARC
}
@end

```

**Important Note:**  Modern Objective-C development uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). ARC largely eliminates the manual use of `retain`, `release`, `autorelease`, and `dealloc` and the issue is less likely to occur if you're using ARC.  However, understanding the underlying principles remains essential for debugging and working with legacy code.
